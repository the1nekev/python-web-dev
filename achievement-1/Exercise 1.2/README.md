# Exercise 1.2

## Task

- name (str): Contains the name of the recipe
- cooking_time (int): Contains the cooking time in minutes
- ingredients (list): Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type

I have decided to use dictionaries for storing the above data for each recipe because of the different data types needing to be stored and the flexibility of dictionaries. Dictionaries can store the recipe names as strings, the ingredients as lists, and the cooking time as integers and are also mutable so each recipe can be updated or added to in the future.

all_recipes = [ ]

I have decided to use a list as the outer structure to store the recipe dictionaries because lists are sequential and can store multiple recipes that can be modified if needed.

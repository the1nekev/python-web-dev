Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

Reflection Questions

In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? 
If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

RESPONSE: 
-The front-end is what users see/interact with the web back-end deals with 
data storage and business logic. 
- As a backend dev id be working on databases, authentication, and with APIs.


Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, 
and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? 
Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
(Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)

RESPONSE:
-Both JavaScript and python are high level languages that aren't hard to comprehend and are dynamic typing. with python, the main benefit would be readabilty.
if the project keeps expanding and more devs need to look at the code base, it will be easier for devs to understand what is going on.
Also, python has built in package management and an active community that is always updating python. 

Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. 
You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? 
What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

RESPONSE:
-I want to better understand object oriented programming.
-I want to learn how to write scripts to automate tasks.

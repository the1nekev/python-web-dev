Databases have various advantages over regular local storage. They keep data in a standardized format so you can store and access it more easily; they can be made secure through password access; and, thanks to databases’ universally acceptable format, you can access them using applications other than Python as well. Database Management Systems (DBMS’s) offer interfaces which let you read, store, and modify data with ease.

You’ll begin this Exercise by recapping Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and Structured Query Language (SQL). Next, you’ll dive deep into how Python scripts work with databases. This will give you a solid foundation for your next Achievement, where you’ll be working with databases from web application frameworks.
